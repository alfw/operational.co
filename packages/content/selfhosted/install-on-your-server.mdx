# Install on your server

For this example, you'll need a ubuntu vps with the following installed:

- nodejs 20.x
- mysql 8.x
- a domain(subdomain is fine)

1. git clone https://github.com/operational-co/operational.co in your server
2. go to /backend and create a .env from the env-template
3. go to /app and create a .env from the env-template

Rest of the guide coming soon.
