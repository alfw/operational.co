# Operational self-hosted

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Operational! This guide will help you setup your own Operational self-hosted instance.

Currently we have guides on hosting Operational on:

- Local server
- On a VPS

Guides for other environments and one-click solutions are coming soon.

Read about the environment variables first. They control how your instance will behave.
